# Getting Started with Vite React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
Vite optimizes the build for best performance and faster load times.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Locally previews a production build from the `dist` folder.  
Useful for testing the production build before deployment.

## Learn More

You can learn more about Vite in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).  
To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### Why Vite?

Vite is a modern frontend tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience. It uses native ES modules during development and bundles your code using Rollup for production. Key benefits include:

- Lightning-fast cold starts and hot module replacement (HMR).
- Optimized builds with tree-shaking and code-splitting.
- Modern development environment with minimal configuration.

## Deployment

Follow Vite's official guide for deployment: [Vite Deployment Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html).

### Common Issues

#### `npm run build` fails

Check Vite's troubleshooting guide: [Vite Troubleshooting](https://vitejs.dev/guide/troubleshooting.html).

#### Hot Module Replacement (HMR) not working

Ensure your Vite config and development server settings are properly configured.
